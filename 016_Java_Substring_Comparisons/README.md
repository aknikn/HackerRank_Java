# 016: [Java Substring Comparisons](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-string-compare/problem "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-string-compare/problem")
- level: Easy
- language: Java


## Description of the problem
We define the following terms:
- Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows:
> A < B < … < Y < Z < a < b < … < y < z

For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.<br><br>

- A substring of a string is a contiguous block of characters in the string.
For example, the substrings of abc are a, b, c, ab, bc, and abc.<br>
Given a string, s, and an integer, k, complete the function so that it finds the lexicographically smallest and largest substrings of length k.

### Function Description
Complete the getSmallestAndLargest function in the editor below.<br>
getSmallestAndLargest has the following parameters:<br>
- string s: a string
- int k: the length of the substrings to find

### Returns
- string: the string ' + "\n" + ' where and are the two substrings

### Imput Format
The first line contains a string denoting s.<br>
The second line contains an integer denoting k.

### Constraints
- 0 ≦ |s| ≦ 100
- s consists of english alphabetic letters only (i.e., [a-zA-Z]).

### Sample Input
> welcometojava<br>
> 3

### Sample Output
> ava<br>
> wel

### Explanation
String s has the following lexicographically-ordered substrings of length k = 3:<br>
["ava", "com", "elc", "eto", "jav", "lco", "met", "oja", "ome", "toj", "wel"]<br>
We then return the first (lexicographically smallest) substring and the last (lexicographically largest) substring as two newline-separated values (i.e., ava\nwel).<br>
The stub code in the editor then prints ava as our first line of output and wel as our second line of output.
