# 050: [Java Method Overriding 2 (Super Keyword)](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-method-overriding-2-super-keyword "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-method-overriding-2-super-keyword")
- level: Easy

## Description of the problem
When a method in a subclass overrides a method in superclass, it is still possible to call the overridden method using super keyword.<br>
If you write super.func() to call the function func(), it will call the method that was defined in the superclass.<br><br>

You are given a partially completed code in the editor.<br>
Modify the code so that the code prints the following text:

> Hello I am a motorcycle, I am a cycle with an engine.<br>
> My ancestor is a cycle who is a vehicle with pedals.
