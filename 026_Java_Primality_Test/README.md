# 026: [Java Primality Test](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-primality-test/problem "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-primality-test/problem")
- level: Easy
- language: Java


## Description of the problem
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 whose only positive divisors are 1 and itself.<br>
For example, the first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.<br><br>

Given a large integer, *n*, use the Java BigInteger class' isProbablePrime method to determine and print whether it's prime or not prime.

### Imput Format
A single line containing an integer, n (the number to be checked).

### Constraints
- *n* contains at most 100 digits.

### Output Format
If *n* is a prime number, print prime; otherwise, print not prime.

### Sample Input
> 13

### Sample Output
> prime

### Explanation
The only positive divisors of 13 are 1 and 13, so we print prime.
