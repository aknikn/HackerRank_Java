# 037: [Java Generics](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-generics/problem "https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-generics/problem")
- level: Easy
- language: Java


Generic methods are a very efficient way to handle multiple datatypes using a single method.<br>
This problem will test your knowledge on Java Generic methods.<br>

Let's say you have an integer array and a string array.<br>
You have to write a single method printArray that can print all the elements of both arrays.<br>
The method should be able to accept both integer arrays or string arrays.<br>

You are given code in the editor.<br>
Complete the code so that it prints the following lines:

> 1<br>
> 2<br>
> 3<br>
> Hello<br>
> World

Do not use method overloading because your answer will not be accepted.
